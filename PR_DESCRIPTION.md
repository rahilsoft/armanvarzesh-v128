# ArmanVarzesh — Final PR (Phases 1–5)

**Date:** 2025-08-15

This PR merges all implementation work from the five phases:
- **Phase 1:** Boundaries, Outbox/Idempotency schema + services, GraphQL utils, security bootstrap, CI, security scans, OTEL guide, media worker skeleton.
- **Phase 2:** Prisma repos (Outbox/Idempotency), GraphQL context loaders stub, presigned upload controller, preview workflows, alert rules.
- **Phase 3:** Request-scoped DataLoaders + interceptor, OTEL NodeSDK bootstrap, /metrics endpoint, media schema + enqueue service, payments reconciliation scaffold.
- **Phase 4:** Media E2E (`/presign` + `/confirm`), Outbox dispatcher, payment webhooks with idempotency, JWKS endpoint, BFF web/mobile, OTEL resource attrs.
- **Phase 5:** Health checks, structured logging (pino), metrics instrumentation, docker-compose, k8s manifests, k6 load tests, security/ops docs.

## Notes
- `AppModule` has been cleaned to ensure imports/providers are deduplicated and required modules are present.
- Run DB migrations: Phase 1 + Phase 3 SQL files (additive).
- Ensure ENV from `.env.example` is set for local/dev.

See the PR checklist for validation steps.
