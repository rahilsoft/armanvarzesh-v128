# Security & Performance Hardening (Next Steps)

This repo was auto-updated to standardize Node/pnpm and CI. For production hardening, complete these **code-level** tasks:

## GraphQL
- Add **DataLoader** for relation resolvers (avoid N+1).
- Enforce **depth/complexity limits** and **required pagination**.
- Disable `playground` and `introspection` in production (tie to `GRAPHQL_PLAYGROUND=false`, `GRAPHQL_INTROSPECTION=false`).

## Security
- Restrict **CORS** to exact origins in production (`CORS_ORIGIN`).
- Add **rate limiting** (Redis-backed) across APIs.
- Use **JWT** with `iss/aud` claims, **key rotation** (KID), and refresh-token revocation list.

## Performance
- Introduce **Redis caching** for read-heavy GraphQL queries.
- Review **DB indexes** using real-world queries; consider **partitioning** high-churn tables.

## Observability
- Wire **OpenTelemetry** traces/metrics/logs; export to Grafana/Loki/Tempo.
- Define **SLOs** (latency, error rate) and alerts.
