# ADR â€” Phase 5 (Security, Observability, Consistency)

## Decisions
- Introduced inbox-service and pluralized services (`assessments-service`, `rewards-service`).
- Hardened API Gateway with rate limiting and audit logs.
- Added SBOM generation and dependency review in CI.
- Added Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerts for new SLOs.

## Migration Notes
- If legacy `assessment-service` or `reward-service` exist, create DB views or dual-write bridges temporarily.
- Rename endpoints to plural forms and update clients. Maintain 301/Proxy for old paths until deprecation window ends.

## Security
- Rotate JWT/license secrets quarterly; use sealed-secrets in GitOps.
- Keep request audit logs for 90 days with PII-minimization.
