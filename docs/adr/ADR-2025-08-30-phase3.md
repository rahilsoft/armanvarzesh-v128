# ADR â€” Phase 3 (GPS Activities, Timer Suite, Challenges)

## Decision
- Introduced `activities-service` with Prisma-backed sessions/routes models and REST endpoints.
- Introduced `challenges-service` for listing and participation flows.
- Mobile app gained Activities, Timer Suite, and Challenges tabs.

## Rationale
- Keep domains decoupled for scalability and DDD clarity.
- Clean migration path for real-time tracking and leaderboards.

## Notes
- Map rendering requires react-native-maps or Mapbox; wiring points are ready.
- Battery benchmark methodology documented in /docs/perf/ (to be extended in pipeline).
