# ADR â€” Phase 1 Integration (Hydration, Paywall, Explore)

## Context
We needed to reach theme parity by shipping hydration logging, an in-app paywall, and explore feed filters.

## Decision
- Extend `nutrition-service` to host Hydration REST endpoints using Prisma model `HydrationLog`.
- Add API Gateway routes to proxy to nutrition, payments, and content services.
- Add RN screens for Hydration, Paywall, Explore in `app/user-app`.

## Alternatives
- Introduce a standalone `health-service`: cleaner domain separation but heavier infra.
- Implement GraphQL-only: would require wider schema adoption in clients.

## Consequences
- Minimal infra change; feature is shippable behind flags.
- Future extraction to `health-service` remains possible via DB table ownership transfer.
