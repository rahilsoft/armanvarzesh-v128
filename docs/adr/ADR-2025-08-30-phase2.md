# ADR â€” Phase 2 (Habits, Wearables, Social Compare)

## Decision
- Habits/Streak implemented inside nutrition-service for lower infra overhead.
- Wearables ingestion endpoint maps steps/water to Habits so Today card reflects synced data.
- Social compare proxied via API Gateway to social-subgraph.

## Consequences
- Future extraction to a standalone health-service is still possible.
- Prometheus gauge `wearable_ingestion_lag_seconds` added for ingestion latency SLO.
