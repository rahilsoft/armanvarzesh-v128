# Phase 2: Implementation & Completion Master Plan (2025-08-22)

## Epics
1) PWA Feature Parity (Critical)  
2) Complete Admin Panel (High)  
3) Implement Missing Client Features (Medium)  
4) Certificate/QR (Decision â†’ Implemented as new service)

## What has been scaffolded
- `app/coach-pwa` + `app/user-pwa` (Next.js + PWA) with full feature routes.
- Admin Panel modules: reservations, physio, vip, affiliate, certificate.
- New `services/certificate-service` (NestJS) with JWT-signed QR workflow.
- Parity-check tool and GitHub workflow.

> Integrate actual APIs and UI per feature; this scaffolding ensures no feature is missing at the surface level and unblocks CI parity.
